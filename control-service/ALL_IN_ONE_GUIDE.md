## Demo Overview
- Intelligent dynamic headway (2–30 minutes) vs fixed scheduling
- Responds to demand surges within 2–3 minutes
- Business value: +25–40% ridership, −15–20% operational cost, 60–75% wait time reduction

---

## Quick Start (Docker)

### Start Services
```bash
# Development
docker-compose up -d control-service transport-service

# Production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d control-service transport-service
```

### Verify Health
```bash
docker-compose ps control-service transport-service
# If issues
docker-compose logs control-service --tail=100
```

### Run Demos
```bash
# Quick test (non-interactive)
docker exec control-service python /app/src/ai_scheduler/examples/test_dynamic_demo.py

# Full interactive demo (recommended)
docker exec -it control-service bash
cd /app/src/ai_scheduler/examples
python detailed_demand_demo.py
```

---

## Demo Scripts and Flows

### Scripts
- test_dynamic_demo.py: 2–3 minute validation
- detailed_demand_demo.py: 15–20 minute presentation

### Flow (15–20 minutes)
1. Baseline vs Dynamic (problem)
2. Real-Time Headway Adjustments (8 time periods)
3. High-Impact Scenarios (rush hour, events, rain)
4. System Intelligence (constraints, algorithm)
5. Business Impact (ROI, KPIs)

### Scenarios (Examples)
- Morning Rush: 800 → 4,500; 15min → 3min (≈5x)
- Evening Rush: 5,200; 15min → 2min
- Special Events: 1,500 → 6,000; 10min → 2min
- Off-peak: 800–900; 12–15min or maintain

### Algorithm (Concept)
```python
def calculate_optimal_headway(passenger_demand, base_headway):
    trains_needed = passenger_demand / (train_capacity * 0.7)  # 70% comfort
    optimal_headway = 3600 / trains_needed
    return max(120, min(optimal_headway, 1800))  # 2–30 min
```

---

## One-Liner Commands
```bash
# Start services and run quick test
docker-compose up -d control-service transport-service && \
  sleep 30 && \
  docker exec control-service python /app/src/ai_scheduler/examples/test_dynamic_demo.py

# Production quick run
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d control-service && \
  sleep 30 && \
  docker exec control-service python /app/src/ai_scheduler/examples/detailed_demand_demo.py

# Direct quick test (no interactive session)
docker exec control-service python /app/src/ai_scheduler/examples/test_dynamic_demo.py
```

---

## Troubleshooting & Health Checks

### Validation Script (Recommended)
```bash
bash control-service/validate-docker-demo.sh
# Expected: "SUCCESS! Your Docker environment is ready for the demo!"
```

### Manual Checks
```bash
# Status
docker-compose ps control-service transport-service

# Logs
docker-compose logs control-service -f

# Python env & dependencies
docker exec control-service python --version
docker exec control-service python -c "\
import sys; sys.path.append('/app/src'); \
from ai_scheduler.services.forecast_service import ForecastService; \
print('Demo dependencies: OK')"

# Demo files
docker exec control-service ls -la /app/src/ai_scheduler/examples/
```

### Common Issues
- Container not running: start/restart services
- Service unhealthy: check logs, rebuild if needed
- gRPC connection fails: ensure transport-service is healthy
- Prophet import errors: confirm it’s installed in the image
- Interactive issues: use `docker exec -it control-service bash`

### Quick Fixes
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs control-service

# Restart
docker-compose restart control-service transport-service

# Full rebuild
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build control-service
```

---

## Success Checklists

### Demo Ready
- control-service and transport-service healthy
- validate-docker-demo.sh passes
- Quick test demo runs
- Interactive session works (`docker exec -it`)
- No Python import or gRPC issues

### Presentation Success Criteria
- Dynamic headway changes clearly shown and understood
- Strong business value; technical feasibility proven
- Clear next steps agreed

---

## Production Deployment Guide

### Status & Objectives
- MVP with intelligent synthetic patterns — READY FOR PRODUCTION
- Day-1 value: 20–30% improvement over fixed scheduling

### Completed (MVP)
- Intelligent time bands (weekday/weekend)
- VN peak hours (6:30–8:30, 17:00–19:30)
- Dynamic headway: 3–15 minutes
- Lunch break optimization (11:00–13:30)
- Weekend leisure patterns
- Board demo with business metrics

### Environment Configuration
```bash
TRANSPORT_GRPC_HOST=transport-service-prod
TRANSPORT_GRPC_PORT=50051
MODEL_DIR=/data/models
PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT=5000
```

### Deployment Infrastructure (to finalize)
- Docker production build (multi-stage)
- Kubernetes manifests
- Health check endpoint integration
- Prometheus metrics
- Structured log aggregation

### Monitoring & Key Metrics
- schedule_generation_duration_seconds
- trips_generated_per_route_total
- headway_optimization_ratio
- time_band_utilization_percent
- grpc_request_duration_seconds

---

## Roadmap: Real Data & Advanced AI

### Phase 2: Real Data Integration (3–6 months)
- Passenger data collector (turnstiles, app analytics, ticket sales, sensors)
- Time-series storage (e.g., InfluxDB)
- Prophet training pipeline with real data and VN-specific seasonalities
- Weather and special events adjustment
- System-wide optimization across routes and constraints

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (6–12 months)
- Real-time adjustments (current load, delays, events)
- Predictive maintenance-aware scheduling
- Multi-modal integration and advanced analytics

---

## Business Impact & KPIs

### Expected Improvements
- Peak: 3–5x frequency (15min → 3min)
- Off-peak: maintain or optimize (15min → 12–15min)
- Wait times: −60–75% during rush hours
- Overcrowding: eliminated or significantly reduced

### KPIs
- Passenger satisfaction: wait time reduction, frequency improvement, survey scores
- Operational efficiency: energy savings, crew and fleet utilization
- Revenue: ridership increase, revenue per trip, peak-hour revenue

---

## Risk Mitigation
- Fallback: synthetic patterns always available
- Monitoring: real-time health tracking
- Rollback: quick switch to fixed scheduling
- Gradual rollout: start with one route, daily KPI tracking, stakeholder updates

---

## Appendix

### Helpful Commands
```bash
# Enter container interactively
docker exec -it control-service bash

# Navigate to demos inside container
cd /app/src/ai_scheduler/examples

# Quick test then full demo
python test_dynamic_demo.py
python detailed_demand_demo.py
```

### Notes
- Networking: control-service ↔ transport-service via internal Docker network (gRPC `transport-service:50051`)
- Dev mounts: `./control-service:/app` (live code); production uses built image
- Resource: ~512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU; Prophet ~50MB

---

Bullseye for the board: dynamic, AI-driven scheduling that adapts to real demand and delivers immediate business value.
